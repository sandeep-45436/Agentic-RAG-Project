# Specification for Hybrid Agentic Retrieval-Augmented Generation (Agentic RAG)
Authors: Dr. K. S. Rao, Prof. A. V. Ramanathan, S. Patel (Department of Computer Science & Engineering)

1. Executive Abstract
Traditional Dense Retrieval-Augmented Generation (Dense RAG) suffers from semantic drift and catastrophic context failure when confronted with multi-hop institutional reasoning. In this paper, we specify the ALITS Agentic RAG architecture incorporating an autonomous LangGraph orchestration state machine, Neo4j knowledge graph topology traversal, and a verifiable token-grounding firewall.

2. Architecture & State Graph
The system operates as a 5-stage directed acyclic graph:
- Router Node: Dispatches queries across Dense Vector Index (Qdrant HNSW cosine metric) or Entity Relational Traversal (Neo4j Cypher engine).
- Retrieval Node: Executes top-k=5 nearest-neighbor extraction with reciprocal rank fusion (RRF) parameterized by k_rrf = 60.
- Grounding Verifier Node: Assesses entailment probability P(H | E) between candidate claims and source citations.
- Self-Correction Node: Triggers iterative query reformulation if citation density falls below 1.2 citations per 100 generated tokens.
- Synthesis Node: Emits structured markdown with explicit [Doc: fileName] grounding badges.

3. Mathematical Formulation
Let Q denote the incoming user query and D = {d_1, d_2, ..., d_N} be the authorized document corpus. The hybrid retrieval scoring function is given by:
S_{hybrid}(d_i, Q) = \\lambda \\cdot \\cos(\\mathbf{e}_Q, \\mathbf{e}_{d_i}) + (1 - \\lambda) \\cdot \\text{BM25}(Q, d_i) + \\gamma \\sum_{r \\in \\mathcal{R}} \\mathbb{I}(e_Q \\to e_{d_i})
where \\lambda = 0.65 represents the vector-lexical balancing weight and \\gamma = 0.35 scales multi-hop relational path weights across knowledge graph edges.

4. Empirical Results & Hallucination Mitigation
Empirical evaluation across 2,400 university policy queries demonstrates:
- Grounded Faithfulness Score: 98.4% (vs 74.2% for naive cosine RAG).
- Multi-hop traversal latency: Mean 182ms (P99: 340ms).
- Zero hallucination across protected academic ordinances and grading regulations.

# Multi-Hop Evaluation Benchmark for Graph-Augmented Vector Retrieval
Authors: M. Chen, L. Thorne, Dr. P. S. Reddy (AI & Data Science Laboratory)

1. Introduction & Problem Statement
Vector similarity search alone cannot resolve relational queries such as "Which faculty members who teach Distributed Systems also advise undergraduate theses on consensus algorithms?". Such queries require graph neighborhood expansion rather than isolated chunk embedding proximity.

2. Benchmark Datasets & Metrics
We evaluate three pipeline topologies:
A. Pure Dense RAG (1536-dim text-embedding-3-small)
B. Sparse + Dense Ensemble (BM25 + Dense)
C. Knowledge Graph Vector Fusion (Neo4j GraphRAG + Qdrant)

Evaluation Metrics:
- Exact Match (EM) %
- F1 Token Grounding Score
- Average Hops Explored
- Index Construction Overhead (CPU Hours)

3. Comparative Benchmark Results
Pipeline A (Dense): EM = 58.3%, F1 = 68.7%, Failure rate on 3-hop questions = 41.2%.
Pipeline B (Ensemble): EM = 69.1%, F1 = 76.4%, Failure rate on 3-hop questions = 29.8%.
Pipeline C (Graph-Vector Fusion): EM = 84.2%, F1 = 91.6%, Failure rate on 3-hop questions = 4.3%.

4. Identified Gaps & Open Challenges
- Cold-start graph extraction requires expensive LLM triplet generation.
- Dynamic entity synchronization during real-time document modification introduces temporal staleness.

# Reflective Synthesis and Hallucination Suppression in Campus LLMs
Authors: Prof. S. R. Bharadwaj, T. A. Venkatesh

1. Context & Motivation
Large Language Models deployed in higher education administrative portals must never provide ungrounded assumptions regarding student credits, exam eligibility, or graduation prerequisites. This study quantifies the impact of self-reflective verification loops during synthesis.

2. Verification Loss Formulation
We define the synthesis objective function as:
\mathcal{L}_{total} = \mathcal{L}_{CE}(y, \hat{y}) + \alpha \mathcal{L}_{grounding}(\hat{y}, \mathcal{D}_{auth}) + \beta \mathcal{D}_{KL}(P_{model} \parallel P_{reference})
Where \mathcal{L}_{grounding} penalizes named entities in \hat{y} that do not possess exact substring or lemmatized provenance in authorized source corpus \mathcal{D}_{auth}.

3. Key Findings
- Temperature sensitivity: At temperature T=0.2, citation fidelity reaches 99.1%. At T=0.7, creative synthesis improves podcast engagement but factual error rate rises to 6.4%.
- Two-pass reflection reduces citation attribution errors by 82.5% at an amortized latency cost of 240ms per query.

# Architectural Specification of RVV 1.0 Vector Extensions for Edge Inference
Authors: Dr. N. Sundaram, E. K. Vasudevan (VLSI & Embedded Systems Laboratory)

1. Executive Abstract
The open-source RISC-V ISA (RV64GCV) provides scalable vector processing capabilities for low-power edge neural network inference. We document register configurations, chaining behaviors, and SIMD pipeline latency profiles across 256-bit vector registers (VLEN=256, SEW=32).

2. Pipeline Datapath & Vector Register Allocation
- Vector Register File (VRF): 32 vector registers (v0 - v31) with configurable grouping factor LMUL \in {1/8, 1/4, 1/2, 1, 2, 4, 8}.
- Vector Execution Units: 4 parallel FMA (Fused Multiply-Accumulate) pipelines operating at 1.2 GHz clock frequency in TSMC 16nm FinFET.
- Dynamic energy dissipation: 14.2 mW/GFLOP under INT8 matrix multiplication workloads.

3. Mathematical Formulation of Pipeline Latency
The total latency for a vector convolution layer with batch size B and kernel dimensions K \times K is modeled by:
T_{exec} = \left\lceil \frac{H_{out} \cdot W_{out} \cdot C_{out}}{VLEN / SEW} \right\rceil \cdot \left( \tau_{issue} + \frac{K^2 \cdot C_{in}}{LMUL} \cdot \tau_{fma} \right) + \tau_{stall}
where \tau_{fma} = 2 clock cycles under pipelined vector chaining.

# Thermal Dissipation and DVFS Scheduling in Sub-5W Edge Neural Accelerators
Authors: P. Mukherjee, Dr. R. Ananthakrishnan

1. Introduction
Edge processors embedded in autonomous IoT nodes face stringent thermal throttling boundaries (<75°C junction temperature). We evaluate Dynamic Voltage and Frequency Scaling (DVFS) algorithms to prevent thermal runaway while sustaining real-time inference deadlines (30 FPS).

2. Heat Transfer Model
The chip thermal profile follows the lumped RC thermal network:
C_{th} \frac{dT(t)}{dt} = P_{dynamic}(t) + P_{static}(T) - \frac{T(t) - T_{ambient}}{R_{th}}
Where static leakage power follows the exponential temperature dependency:
P_{static}(T) = V_{dd} \cdot I_{leak0} \cdot e^{\frac{q(V_{gs} - V_{th})}{n k_B T}}

3. Experimental Results
- Implementing proactive thermal throttling reduces peak junction temperature by 14.8°C with negligible (<3.2%) FPS throughput penalty.
- Sleep-state power gating achieves 98.6% leakage reduction during idle inter-frame periods.

# Distributed Artificial Potential Field Navigation for Large-Scale Aerial Swarms
Authors: Dr. V. K. Nambiar, A. Sengupta, G. Prakash (Robotics & Autonomous Systems Group)

1. Executive Overview
Autonomous multi-rotor swarms navigating cluttered 3D urban canyons require decentralized, O(1) collision avoidance algorithms that do not depend on centralized trajectory coordination. We present a Modified Artificial Potential Field (M-APF) algorithm eliminating local minima traps.

2. Mathematical Formulation
The net force acting on agent i with position \mathbf{p}_i and velocity \mathbf{v}_i is:
\mathbf{F}_{net, i} = \mathbf{F}_{att, i}(\mathbf{p}_{goal}) + \sum_{j \in \mathcal{N}_i} \mathbf{F}_{rep, ij}(\mathbf{p}_j) + \sum_{k \in \mathcal{O}} \mathbf{F}_{obs, ik}(\mathbf{p}_k)
Where repulsive force decays quadratically with separation distance d_{ij}:
\mathbf{F}_{rep, ij} = \begin{cases} k_{rep} \left( \frac{1}{d_{ij}} - \frac{1}{d_0} \right) \frac{1}{d_{ij}^2} \hat{\mathbf{r}}_{ij} & \text{if } d_{ij} \le d_0 \\ 0 & \text{otherwise} \end{cases}

3. Swarm Flocking Stability
Using Lyapunov candidate function V(\mathbf{x}) = \frac{1}{2}\sum_i m_i \|\mathbf{v}_i\|^2 + \frac{1}{2}\sum_i \sum_{j \ne i} U_{ij}(\mathbf{p}_i, \mathbf{p}_j), we prove asymptotic stability and collision-free flocking under communication radii R_c \ge 2.5 d_0.

1. Abstract
Telemetry and obstacle sharing across high-mobility aerial nodes require ultra-reliable low-latency communication (URLLC). We benchmark Hybrid Wireless Mesh Protocol (HWMP) enhancements with predictive link-quality estimation based on Kalman-filtered Doppler shifts.

2. Metric Analysis
- Packet Delivery Ratio (PDR): 99.4% at swarm velocities up to 18 m/s.
- Average end-to-end hop latency: 4.8 ms across 5 mesh relay hops.
- Route re-convergence time during node drop: 28 ms.

# Lightweight Byzantine Quorum Consensus for Autonomous Robotic Swarms
Authors: R. D. Deshmukh, Dr. A. K. Choudhury

1. Abstract & Threat Model
In adversarial or GPS-denied environments, compromised drone nodes may broadcast spoofed waypoint coordinates or malicious telemetry. We introduce SwarmPBFT, a cryptographic leader election and consensus protocol resilient against f < n/3 Byzantine faulty nodes.

2. Quorum Consensus Phases
1. Pre-Prepare: Leader broadcasts timestamped waypoint assignment signed with Ed25519 key.
2. Prepare: Nodes verify cryptographic signature and broadcast Prepare vote to neighborhood.
3. Commit: Upon receiving 2f + 1 valid Prepare votes, node transitions to trajectory execution.

# తెలుగు సహజ భాషా ప్రాసెసింగ్‌లో స్వరూప విభజన మరియు సబ్‌వర్డ్ టోకనైజేషన్ (Morphological Segmentation and Subword Tokenization in Telugu NLP)
Authors: Prof. B. Srinivas, Dr. R. Lakshmi, K. Ananya (Department of Computer Science & Indic Computing)

1. కార్యనిర్వాహక సారాంశం (Executive Abstract)
తెలుగు భాష ఒక సంశ్లేషణాత్మక (agglutinative) మరియు సంధి-సమాసాల సమృద్ధి కలిగిన ద్రావిడ భాష. ప్రామాణిక బైట్-పెయిర్ ఎన్‌కోడింగ్ (BPE) పద్ధతులు తెలుగు అక్షర సముదాయాలపై విఫలమవుతూ అధిక ఫెర్టిలిటీ రేటు (Fertility Rate > 4.2) నమోదు చేస్తున్నాయి. ఈ పరిశోధనా పత్రంలో, తెలుగు వ్యాకరణ సూత్రాలు మరియు సంధి విచ్ఛేద ఆధారిత అక్షర-మూల విభజన (Morpho-Lexical Segmentation) ప్రవేశపెట్టబడింది.

2. అల్గోరిథం విధానం & గణిత సూత్రీకరణ (Algorithmic Methodology)
ప్రామాణిక పద సముదాయం $W$ మరియు విభజన బిందువులు $S = \\{s_1, s_2, \\dots, s_k\\}$ అనుకుంటే, సరైన విభజన సంభావ్యత:
$$P(S | W) = \\prod_{i=1}^{k} P(m_i | m_{i-1}) \\cdot \\exp\\left(-\\alpha \\cdot \\text{Penalty}_{sandhi}(m_i)\\right)$$
ఇక్కడ $m_i$ అనేది గుర్తించబడిన మార్ఫిమ్ (morpheme), మరియు $\\alpha = 0.42$ అనేది సంధి నియమాల ఉల్లంఘన అపరాధ గుణకం (penalty factor).

3. ప్రయోగాత్మక ఫలితాలు (Experimental Results)
- ప్రామాణిక LLaMA-3 టోకనైజర్‌తో పోలిస్తే టోకెన్ సంఖ్య 58.4% తగ్గింది.
- తెలుగు సమాచార సంగ్రహణలో (Information Retrieval) ఖచ్చితత్వం: F1-స్కోరు 93.8%.
- సగటు ప్రాసెసింగ్ వేగం: 142ms ప్రతి 1000 పదాలకు.

1. పరిచయం & సమస్య సూత్రీకరణ (Introduction & Problem Formulation)
ఆంగ్ల భాషలోని విజ్ఞాన భాండాగారాలను తెలుగులోకి అనువదించేటప్పుడు సందర్భానుసార లోపాలు (Contextual Hallucinations) మరియు అస్పష్టమైన సైటేషన్లు ఉత్పన్నమవుతాయి. ఈ పత్రంలో, అధీకృత పత్రాల నుండి నిజ-సమయ ఆధారాలను తెలుగు లిపిలో ప్రత్యక్షంగా పొందుపరిచే నూతన ద్వంద్వ-దశల ఆర్కిటెక్చర్ ప్రతిపాదించబడింది.

2. ఆర్కిటెక్చర్ నిర్మాణం (Architecture Overview)
- ఎంబెడ్డింగ్ లేయర్: బహుభాషా mE5 మరియు ఇండిక్-సెమాంటిక్ వెక్టర్ మోడల్స్ కలయిక.
- నాలెడ్జ్ గ్రాఫ్ అన్వేషణ: నియో4జె (Neo4j) గ్రాఫ్‌లో తెలుగు నామవాచకాలు మరియు క్రియల సంబంధాలను అనుసంధానించే సైఫర్ (Cypher) క్వెరీలు.
- సైటేషన్ ధృవీకరణ: ప్రతి తెలుగు పేరాగ్రాఫ్ కచ్చితంగా సంబంధిత డాక్యుమెంట్ ట్యాగ్‌ను [Doc: fileName] కలిగి ఉండటాన్ని తప్పనిసరి చేసే ఫైర్‌వాల్.

3. పరిశోధనా ఫలితాలు (Benchmark Findings)
- తెలుగు న్యాయ మరియు విద్యా నిబంధనలలో విశ్వసనీయత: 97.6%.
- సెమాంటిక్ అనువాద విచలనం 3.1% కంటే తక్కువగా నియంత్రించబడింది.

# తెలుగు ధ్వనిశాస్త్రం మరియు నాణ్యమైన న్యూరల్ టెక్స్ట్-టు-స్పీచ్ (Phonetic Acoustics and Neural TTS for Telugu)
Authors: S. V. Prasad, M. Haritha, Dr. C. H. Venkat (Acoustic Intelligence & Signal Lab)

1. సారాంశం (Abstract)
తెలుగు భాష అజంత భాష (భాషలోని పదాలు అచ్చులతో ముగుస్తాయి - Italian of the East). అందువల్ల టెక్స్ట్-టు-స్పీచ్ (TTS) వ్యవస్థలలో దీర్ఘాలు, హ్రస్వాలు మరియు ఒత్తుల ఉచ్ఛారణకు ప్రత్యేక శ్రద్ధ అవసరం. ఈ పరిశోధన ద్వారా తక్కువ కంప్యూటేషనల్ సామర్థ్యం గల పరికరాలపై కూడా సహజంగా పలికే న్యూరల్ వాయిస్ సింథసైజర్ అభివృద్ధి చేయబడింది.

2. ధ్వని విశ్లేషణ పారామితులు (Acoustic Parameters)
- వర్ణమాల ప్రాతినిధ్యం: 56 తెలుగు అక్షరాల ధ్వని తరంగాల ఆధారంగా ఫోనెటిక్ మ్యాపింగ్.
- శ్రవణ నాణ్యత రేటింగ్ (MOS): 4.65 / 5.0 (ప్రామాణిక మోడల్స్ 3.82 కంటే గణనీయంగా మెరుగు).
- స్పీకర్ల వైవిధ్యం: పరిశోధనా చర్చలకు ఇద్దరు వ్యక్తుల (Alex & Jordan సమానమైన ధ్వని శైలులు) సహజ సంభాషణ నమూనా.
